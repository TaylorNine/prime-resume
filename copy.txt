2 Hill Murray School

Title
UX Consultant // Web Developer // Web Production
April 2017 &mdash; July 2017

Description
<a href=“http://www.hill-murray.org/“ alt=“Hill-Murray.org” target="_blank" class="hvr-underline-from-center”>The Hill Murray school</a> intended to rebrand and relaunch its website and hired me as UX and web design consultant, web developer (as needed) and a web production artist. This was a contract position. They had used a print designer to create the wireframes for the new site. They had also chosen to utilize a vendor named FinalSite that had sold them a content management system with the idea that it would simply plug and play with the current site.

The plug and play nature of the CMS ended up not quite being the case. I built out somewhere around 165-pages that were called for in the wireframes. I also advised on functionality, worked with FinalSite on getting promised assets.

Highlights &amp; Duties
- Built out pages for every aspect of the site, for quick content entry.
- Advised my direct report and other key stakeholders on functionality issues.
- Made reusable web components.

4 YA Engage
UX Designer // Front-End Developer
JANUARY 2015 - SEPTEMBER 2015

Description
<a href=“http://www.yaengage.com/“ alt=“YAEngage.com” target="_blank" class="hvr-underline-from-center”>YA Engage</a>, formerly Young America is a brand engagement company that had been around for many years. I was brought on to work User Experience Design and Front-End Development for client work.

I ended up being selected to help turn all of their digital services into products. I did this with part of their Sweepstakes Program, their Rebate Program and they also asked me to prototype a completely new program called “Refer-A-Friend.” 

The concept is simple, as the name implies. However, I was asked to build a prototype for use in sales meetings (some of which I sat in and guided the clients through) as well as a basic template that the Front-End Team could pick up and essentially just re-skin for other clients. I ended up finishing the Refer-A-Friend prototype and we sold our first copy for $80,000. 

Highlights &amp; Duties
- Work with my direct report on the UX of YA projects.
- Work with the VP of product to turn digital services into products.
- Show the company as (as whole) through presentations and other updates the status of the project.

5 Periscope

Title
Production Artist
AUGUST 2008 &mdash; NOVEMBER 2010

Description
I went in to <a href=“http://www.periscope.com/“ alt=“Periscope.com” target="_blank" class="hvr-underline-from-center”>Periscope</a> during my first year of college for a one-on-one informational tour. I was very interested on how an ad agency worked, especially one like Periscope. The tour was great and I remember how wide-eyed I was walking through the building and seeing the workspaces, the teams and the ways they had designed their workspaces to encourage collaboration.

Three months later during my first summer in college before my second year, I got a call asking if I would like to <i>come work at Periscope!!!</i> I was blown away, I went in for a formal interview and they hired me! Part-time at first (because of my schooling), then I did my internship at Periscope and finally I was hired full-time.  

Highlights &amp; Duties
- Selected to be the layout designer for the 2010 ParAide catalog.
- Selected to be on the UnitedHealthCare Medicaid rebranding campaign.
- Project managers would let me do creative work on their projects when needed.
